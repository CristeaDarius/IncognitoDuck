Erected in 1913, the monument is situated in the vibrant center of Opole, a city with a rich historical tapestry influenced by diverse cultures and traditions over centuries. The monument captures Copernicus in a contemplative pose, emphasizing his dedication to scientific inquiry and the pursuit of knowledge.

Historically, the monument not only commemorates the achievements of Copernicus but also reflects the city's evolving identity during the early 20th century when Poland was still partitioned. The artistic design of the statue, created by sculptor Władysław Siedlecki, showcases mastery in neoclassical art, which resonates with the architectural styles prevalent in that era. The historical context of the monument’s installation is significant, as it symbolizes a moment of Polish national pride amidst the socio-political struggles of the time.
